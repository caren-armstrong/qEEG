function [segments,storage] = rejection(data,rejbins,calcbins,F,Z,feats,amp);
%{
Inputs:
    data: filtered, montaged data with each row a column and channel a
    sample
    rejbins: length of rejection bins, in s
    calcbins: length of bins for calculations, in s
    F: sampling frequency in Hz
    Z: z score thresholding
    feats: number of features, keep set at 2 until additional features are
    included
    amp: amplitude threshold in uV
Outputs:
    segments: a cell matrix containing data segments for qEEG calculations,
    each row of each cell is a channel and each column of each cell is a
    sample
    storage: index boundaries for each usable segment for calculations
